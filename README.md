# UFOs
## Overview

The overview of this project was to present out JavaScript data on a webpage using HTML and CSS styling guides. 

## Results

There are mulitple search critera available on the working webpage (shown below). There is one caveat to the way you can search within the working webpage. For example, if you are wanting to search for UFO sighting in Missouri you CANNOT type Mo or MO, you will pull no search results. When searching you must adhere to the example grey search criteria in the starting search field. Continuing with our Missouri example, instead of typing Mo or MO, you will find the Missouri UFO sighting by typing mo.

## Summary 

One drawback of this webpage is there aren't any links referencing the orgianl sites we pulled the information from. The purpose of the webpage is to find the information quickly but if someone wanted to dig deeper it would be nice to present them with the link for further investigation. 

Something that would be helpful would be similar to what I've done before is adding a scraping file on the backend of the website. That way our frontend presentation could constantly be updated with the latest in UFO sightings. As of right now we are working with static JS data. For presentation it would be cool to have an interactive map underneath our data table to see the frequency of UFO sighting nationally, almost like a temperature map.
